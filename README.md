# Conway's Game of Life on a Spherised Cube

On CodeSandbox, if you what to play.
Running demo: https://hw9oz.csb.app/

I'd missed that John Conway, inventor of the Game of Life, died in April 2020 of COVID-related causes.
Prompted me to have a go at this...I had been wanting to learn React and Three.js and had wondered way back in architecture school what would happen if you made the game of life's board a sphere surface. 



I'd like to:
*prettyify it with some effects
*show some 'lifeform stats'
*make it run smoother...I do not entirely 'get' the whole react, three and fiber thing but the game part of my code, I think runs on react's thread which is the main ui thread, not three's.
