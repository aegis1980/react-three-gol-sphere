# Conway's Game of Life on a Spherised Cube

On CodeSandbox, if you what to play.
Running demo: https://hw9oz.csb.app/

I'd missed that James Conway, inventor of the Game of Life, died in April 2020 of COVID-related causes.
Prompted me to hack this demo together...I had been wanting to learn React and Three.js and had wondered back in architecture school what would happen if you put the GOL on a sphere. 20 years ago i way worse than i am now at coding though. Still not great.

I'd like to:
*prettyify it with some effects
*show some 'lifeform stats'
\*make it run smoother...gol runs on react's thread, not three's.
